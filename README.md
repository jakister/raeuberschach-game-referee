# raeuberschach-game-referee
IBS Projekt Programmierung III
By Jan-Magnus Kister

This project is performed in context of a university module, where the students are to program a non-random, deterministic board-game with a corresponding GUI.
I currently have chosen to do this with RÃ¤uberschach (or losing chess in english), where the player wins if he has no pieces left. This is realized by a must to strike the enemy if the player can, otherwise no player would ever win.
This project is based upon JavaFX and the canvas API, as well as the MVC-Principle.
